<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Introduction to Mahcine Learning Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/machine-learning/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

During this project we implement a series of algorithms that helps us to classify and predict. Some of the algorithms are based on linear and logistic regression. Likewise, we create artificual neural networks in order to classify inputs and create image recognizers.
